        <h3>The Basic Rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The game is played by two teams, each consisting of 11 players.</li>
            <li>The objective of the game is to score goals by getting the ball into the opponent's net.</li>
            <li>Players must use their feet or any part of their body except their hands and arms (except for the
                goalkeeper within their own penalty area) to play the ball.</li>
            <li>A player cannot be in an offside position when receiving the ball unless there are at least two
                opponents between them and the goal line at the moment the ball is played to them.</li>
            <li>A player may not use excessive force against an opponent, commit dangerous or reckless challenges, or
                engage in unsporting behavior.</li>
            <li>When the ball goes out of play, it is restarted with a throw-in, corner kick, or goal kick, depending on
                which team touched the ball last.</li>
            <li>A game consists of two halves, typically 45 minutes each, with a short break (half-time) in between.
            </li>
            <li>The team that scores the most goals by the end of the game wins.</li>
        </ul>

    <rules-page-section id="freekicks">
        <h3>Free Kick Rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player commits a foul or an infringement of the
                rules.</li>
            <li>The ball must be stationary when the free kick is taken.</li>
            <li>The opposing players must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it is in play.</li>
            <li>The player taking the free kick can either pass the ball to a teammate or shoot directly at the goal.
            </li>
            <li>If the free kick is taken inside the penalty area, it becomes a goal kick for the defending team if the
                ball does not leave the penalty area.</li>
            <li>If the free kick is taken outside the penalty area, the ball is considered in play once it has been
                touched and moves.</li>
            <li>If an attacking player is fouled inside the penalty area, a penalty kick is awarded instead of a free
                kick.</li>
            <li>A player who takes a free kick cannot touch the ball again until it has touched another player.</li>
        </ul>

    <rules-page-section id="subs">
        <h3>Subsitution Rules</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>A team is allowed a certain number of substitutions during a match to replace players.</li>
            <li>In most competitions, each team is allowed three substitutions per match.</li>
            <li>Additional substitutions may be allowed in extra time or knockout stages of tournaments.</li>
            <li>Substitutions can only be made when the ball is out of play and with the permission of the referee.</li>
            <li>A substituted player must leave the field of play at the nearest boundary line, usually at the halfway
                line.</li>
            <li>Substituted players can take no further part in the match once they have been replaced.</li>
            <li>If a team wishes to substitute a player, they must notify the fourth official, who then signals to the
                referee.</li>
            <li>The substitute player must wait at the sideline until they receive permission from the referee to enter
                the field.</li>
        </ul>

    <rules-page-section id="fouls">
        <h3>Foul Rules</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>A foul is an infringement of the rules committed by a player against an opponent.</li>
            <li>Common fouls include tripping, pushing, holding, and excessive physical contact.</li>
            <li>Fouls can result in free kicks, penalty kicks, or yellow and red cards depending on the severity.</li>
            <li>If a player commits a foul while inside their team's penalty area, the opposing team is awarded a
                penalty kick.</li>
            <li>A player who receives two yellow cards in a match is shown a red card and is sent off, resulting in
                their team playing with one less player.</li>
            <li>A player who commits a serious foul play or shows violent conduct may be shown a straight red card and
                is immediately sent off.</li>
            <li>Repeated fouls or unsporting behavior can result in yellow or red cards as a disciplinary measure.</li>
            <li>The referee has the final authority in determining if a foul has been committed and the appropriate
                punishment.</li>
        </ul>
